# Toolkit

This is my toolkit repository.
These are useful scripts for configuring and managing systems.

Install the toolkit using the below instructions.
Once installed, configure the environment using the config tool.
You can manage dotfiles using that tool and you'll be able to select a repository
where you want to sync the configuration from. This could be a branch or a repo
depending on the machine you're on. This allows for differing profiles.

# Installation

```shell
cd ~
git clone git@github.com:liamtbrand/toolkit.git
cd toolkit
./toolkit.sh
```
